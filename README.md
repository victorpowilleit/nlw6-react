Letmeask is a project leaded by [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br) team in the 6th
season of its [NextLevel Week](https://nextlevelweek.com) event, composed by a 5 day code marathon.

It aims to be used in live classes and other live events, allowing the watchers to post questions
or general commentaries on the platform, giving the event manager the ability to quickly spot and
answer the sent messages, visually showing when a message is being and when already has been
answered. Also, the manager of the room can exclude an unwanted message from the pool an finish
the room itself once the event is over.

The project, as proposed, is well structured on the most valuable features of the chosen
technology, getting deeply into good practices and the hard skills expected by the market
